<p>
Below we outline guidelines on how to package artifacts for
submission.  We are open to possibilities that we have not considered
below; however, in cases where systems ought to fit these options, we
suggest authors use them.  
</p>

<p>
In all cases, the artifacts should be accompanied by suitable
documentation, to save committee members the burden of
reverse-engineering what the authors intended (e.g., a dataset is
useless without some explanation on how to browse the data; a tool
without a quick tutorial will be very hard to use).  In particular,
please make concrete what claims you are making of the artifact, if
these differ from the expectations set up by the paper.  This is a
place where you can tell us about difficulties we might encounter in
using the artifact, or its maturity relative to the content of the
paper.  We are still going to evaluate the artifact relative to the
paper, but this helps set expectations up front, especially in cases
that might frustrate the reviewers without prior notice.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>TL;DR</h2>

<p>
Create a submission with the same title as the paper. In the abstract
  field, include two things:
  <ul>
    <li>the paper's abstract (to help with bidding)</li>
    <li>a <strong>URL</strong> pointing to the artifact site</li>
  </ul>
There is no &ldquo;paper&rdquo; to submit.
</p>

<p>
At this URL, give us access to:
  <ul>
    <li>the artifact</li>
    <li><em>the accepted version of the paper</em></li>
    <li>instructions</li>
  </ul>
See below for additional details.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Conflicts</h2>

<p>
If one of the authors is an AEC chair, you may <em>not</em> submit an
artifact. You can, however, indicate in your paper that you were
unable to submit an artifact due to the conflict-of-interest.
</p>

<p>
If you have a conflict-of-interest with anyone on the committee
(including the three chairs), please indicate this in both the Web
page and in your submission email.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Artifact Submission</h2>

<p>
Irrespective of the nature of the artifacts, authors should 
create a <em>single Web page</em> (whether on their site or a third-party
file upload service) that contains <em>the artifact, the paper, and all necessary instructions</em>. 
<p>

<p>
For artifacts where this would be appropriate, it would be helpful to
also provide a self-contained bundle (including instructions) as a
single file (<tt>.tgz</tt> or <tt>.zip</tt>; please avoid exotic
compressors) for convenient offline use: imagine the reviewer who
wants to download a single file to expand and work with during a train
or bus commute.
</p>

<p>
If it would be helfpul, please feel free to include a video that
demonstrates the artifact running or explaining how it should be run.
</p>

<p>
The artifact submission thus consists of just the URL and any
credentials required to access the files.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Confidentiality</h2>

<p>
We ask that, during the evaluation period, you not embed any analytics
or other tracking in the Web site for the artifact or, if you cannot
control this, that you not access this data. This is important for
maintaining the confidentiality of reviewers. If for some reason you
cannot comply with this, please notify the chairs immediately.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Code Artifacts Packaging</h2>

<p>
Authors should strongly consider one of the following methods to
package the software components of their artifacts (though the AEC is
open to other reasonable formats as well):
</p>

<ol>

<li>
   A VM (Virtualbox/VMWare) image containing software application
   already setup in the intended run-time environment (e.g., Mobile
   phone emulator, Real time OS). This is the preferred option: It
   avoids installation and compatibility problems, and provides the
   best guarantees for reproducibility of the results by the
   committee.  Authors using Linux might find the <a href="http://www.pgbovine.net/cde.html">CDE</a> tool 
   useful for automatically creating a VM image from existing software
   without needing to manually re-install all dependencies within a
   VM. Another promising new system is
   <a href="http://vida-nyu.github.io/reprozip/">ReproZip</a>.
</li>

<li>
   A binary installable package. We invite the authors to use CDE
   (Linux) or MSI Installer (Windows) to package the binary
   application.
</li>

<li>
   A live instance running on the Web.
</li>

<li>
   A detailed screen-cast of the tool along with the results,
   especially if one of the following special cases applies:

<ul>
  <li>the application needs proprietary/commercial software that is not
    easily available or cannot be distributed to the committee;</li>

  <li>the application requires significant computation resources (e.g.,
    &gt; 24 hours of execution time to produce the results);</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
   An installation or update repository for the tool (e.g., Eclipse
   update site or a Debian APT repository). However, we urge the
   authors to test their repository on standard environments to avoid
   installation problems by the committee members.
</li>

</ol>

<p>
<em>In all cases</em>, authors should make a genuine effort to not learn
the identity of the reviewers.  This may mean turning off &ldquo;call
home&rdquo; features or analytics, or only using systems with high
enough usage that AEC accesses will not stand out.  In all cases where
tracing is unavoidable, the authors should warn the reviewers in
advance so the reviewers can try to take adequate safeguards.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Non-Code Artifacts Format</h2>

<p>
Non-code artifacts should preferably be in open document formats. For
documents and reports, we invite the authors to use PDF, ODF, or
RTF. We invite the authors to submit experimental data and results in
CSV (preferred option), JSON, or XML file formats.  In the special
case that authors have to submit non-standard data formats, they
should also provide suitable readers.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Special Instructions for the ACM Digital Library</h2>

<p>
We encourage the publication of artifacts through the digital
supplement mechanisms of publishers (such as the ACM Digital Library
and SpringerLink). The following notes (valid as of September 2014)
may be of use to ACM Digital Library users (authors and chairs),
especially since some published or emailed information may appear to
contradict this information:

<ul>

  <li>artifacts larger than 2 GB are fine</li>

  <li>Sheridan will ask you to upload via FTP</li>

  <li>artifact file names should not contain spaces</li>
  
  <li>artifacts count as &ldquo;Auxiliary Material&rdquo;,
  <em>not</em> as &ldquo;Supplementary Material&rdquo;; thus, you do
  <em>not</em> transfer your rights to artifacts to the ACM by
  transferring your rights to the paper</li>

</ul>

Once again, chairs and authors: we strongly encourage archiving
artifacts alongside papers in permanent repositories. You've gone to
all the trouble of packaging your artifact nicely; why not share it?
