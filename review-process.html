<p>
  Artifact evaluation is only open to accepted papers. Authors should
  be notified, ideally starting with the Call for Papers, of the AEC
  process, so they can prepare their artifact for it. Typically,
  artifacts are due a week after paper acceptance notifications go out, giving authors
  time to perform final packaging. Typical AEC review times have been
  about one month.
</p>

<p>
During <em>initial paper submission time</em>, authors should be asked
  both whether they intend to submit an artifact and the <em>skill
  set</em> their artifact will require to evaluate. This gives the AEC chairs
  the opportunity to pick or strengthen their membership to
  accommodate the required skills. (Of course, not all skills will
  eventually be necessary, since this is the list of skills required
  for submitted papers, not accepted ones.)
</p>

Every artifact is reviewed by two committee members.  They are given          
the accepted version of the paper to read before examining the                  
artifacts.  They are then asked to individually submit a detailed              
review along these lines:

Overall assessment.

<li>                                                                            
On what platform/how was the artifact evaluated.                                
</li>

</ul>

<p>                                                                             
Some AECs have used a five-point scale for assessment:
</p>

<ol>

<li>Significantly exceeded expectations</li>
<li>Exceeded expectations</li>
<li>Met expectations</li>
<li>Fell below expectations</li>
<li>Significantly fell below expectations</li>

</ol>

<p>
In practice, however, even a two-point scale (&ldquo;met or exceeded expectations&rdquo;
vs. &ldquo;failed expectations&rdquo;) has sufficed.
</p>

<p>                                                                             
If there is a difference in overall assessment between the two                 
reviewers, they are asked to try to reconcile it between                    
themselves.  Chairs break ties.
</p>

<p>
The final decision needs to be communicated to authors about a week
before the camera-ready deadline, so authors can include the decision
in their paper. The AECs have stipulated nothing about how (or even
whether) to report it.
</p>

<p>                                                                             
One complication with the current AEC structure, coming after the               
papers have been accepted, is that revewiers are required to base              
their views on the paper as is.  Sometimes reviewers are unhappy with          
the paper itself.  They needed to be reminded that they cannot               
allow this to bias their views too much: the AEC is only charged with              
deciding whether the artifact meets the expectations set by the paper,            
no matter how low or incorrect those might be!  This is of course a             
difficult emotional barrier to ignore.

<h3>Conflicts of Interest</h3>

<p>                                                                             
In general, we treat conflicts of interest precisely as we would for          
regular conference papers.                                                      
</p>

<p>                                                                             
One issue to consider is who can submit artifacts.  If              
artifacts become part of the evaluation process of papers, the status           
of AEC members becomes akin to that of PC members.  Since we have
a two-phase approach where paper decisions are made independently of           
and before artifact evaluation, only those with direct          
conflicts with the chairs need to be barred from submitting artifacts.  This means,                  
however, that papers by those authors would not be able indicate their artifact            
quality, which might raise questions with some readers.  
Such authors are therefore welcome to mention in their paper that              
they are prohibited from submitting an artifact due to the conflict            
of interest.
